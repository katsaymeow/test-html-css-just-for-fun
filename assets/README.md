# Description

### Trying out the pre-work lead me to attempt writing a code that would just hold a picture. I was suprised that I was able to complete an entire page! I went in with new knowledge and cleaned it up a bit. I was happy that I structured the html in a way that allowed me to add extra CSS to really define the area. 


### Once I begin understanding more, I plan on maybe turning this into a fun, interactive page.
